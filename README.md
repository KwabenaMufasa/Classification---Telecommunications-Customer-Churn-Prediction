# Classification - Telecommunications Customer Churn Prediction
The goal of this research is to forecast customer churn in the telecom sector. In order to enable the business to take proactive actions to keep these clients, the objective is to develop a classification model that reliably predicts if a customer is likely to leave the service provider.


## Introductions and Overview
----
This is a machine learning project that uses customer data from a telecommunications company to predict which customers are likely to churn (i.e., stop using the company's services).


## Hypothesis
----
1
- H0: There is no significant difference in churn rates between male and female customers.

- H1: There is a significant difference in churn rates between male and female customers.

2
- H0: There is no significant relationship between the customer's internet service provider and their likelihood to churn.

- H1: There is a significant relationship between the customer's internet service provider and their likelihood to churn.

3
- H0: There is no significant difference in churn rates between customers on different types of payment methods.

- H1: There is a significant difference in churn rates between customers on different types of payment methods.

## Questions
----
1. What percentage of customers have churned?
2. Is there a correlation between a customer's length of tenure with the company and their likelihood of churning?
3. Are there any specific groups of customers based on demographic that are more likely to churn than others?
4. Can customer retention be improved by offering longer contract terms?
5. How much money could the company save by reducing customer churn?
6. What is the relationship between Internet Services and churn rate?


## Technologies Used
----
This project uses the following technologies:

Python 3.0
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
and other packages for Machine learning models and hyperparamter tuning as well as cross validation.

## Conclusion
----
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. The trained models can be used to identify customers who are at high risk of churning, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain these customers.
